StreetTraffic Package
=======================

StreetTraffic is a Python server package that monitors the traffic flow data of
your favorite routes, cities and more. By using the API provided by  
`HERE.com <https://developer.here.com/rest-apis/documentation/traffic/topics/quick-start.html>`_
, we are able to crawl the traffic data of areas of interest, and visualize
historical traffic data.
